# Communicating with the attendees

At the moment, event volunteers need to coordinate with the Foundation to
communicate with the event attendees. In order to send emails to the attendees
e.g. communicate the finalized schedule, please reach out to us.

The Foundation uses a self-hosted instance of
[listmonk]](listmonk.fossunited.org) to send bulk emails to the attendees.
