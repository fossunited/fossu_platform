# Project Management

Work on the Platform is planned and executed using a [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/fossunited/projects/3)
at the moment and known issues about the project are tracked using the GitHub
[issues board](https://github.com/fossunited/fossunited/issues/).

- issues that the Foundation is focusing on exist in the `"Todo"` column
- issues that will be prioritized in the future e.g. next month exist in the
  `"No Status"` column
- once an issue gets picked up, it is moved to the `"In Progress"` column and
  the issue gets assigned to the person working on it
- issues usually get auto-closed by GitHub when a Pull Request that addresses
  the issue gets merged and GitHub automation moves them to the `"Done"`
  column
- at the beginning of every month, a new column is manually created for the
  previous month and the issues from the `"Done"` column are manually moved to
  the new column

Apart from documentation, another way to get involved with the project is with
Project Management. For example, we need users of the Platform to discover and
report bugs in the project. We need volunteers to keep an eye on the issue
board and respond to new issues from the Community. Reproducing issues or
responding to the issues with request for additional information to aid in
reproduction of the issue are incredibly valuable ways to contribute to the
project.
