# Code contributions

Code contributions are usually what people refer to when they mean
contributing to a FOSS project and we are glad to receive code contributions.
If you are not sure where to start, we can recommend looking into the codebase
to identify untested code and add unittests. Testing ensures that the Platform
is robust and works as expected and unittests, integration tests, end-to-end
tests, API tests, and more are welcome code contributions.

You could also look at the issue board to identify issues that you would like
to pick up. You don't have to ask us if you want to pick up an issue - as long
as someone isn't already working on the issue, feel free to pick it up and
open a Pull Request addressing the issue. The existing contributors usually
assign themselves to an issue if they are actively working upon it.

Adding new features will likely require knowledge of the [Frappe framework](https://frappeframework.com/)
and if you don't have prior understanding of the framework, please dig in for
a long and time-taking contribution process.
